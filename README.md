This project focuses on detecting fake or tampered Aadhaar cards and similar identity documents using Computer Vision and Deep Learning. The system analyzes key regions of the Aadhaar card such as the QR code, photograph, text fields, and layout patterns to verify authenticity and identify signs of forgery.

The main objective is to build an automated pipeline that:

Extracts visual features from Aadhaar card images.

Validates QR code authenticity and checks for mismatches.

Detects digital manipulations such as edited photos, altered text, or forged holograms.

Classifies documents as Real or Fake using AI models.

This project is designed for security applications, digital KYC systems, and verification workflows.
